# ficher

a webapp to build works of microfiche-based interactive fiction.

## model

Works contain Sheets which contain Pages

* a Work is a complete intellectual entity, equivalent to a book or website
* a Sheet is a piece of microfiche, which has a grid of page images
* a Page is the content a reader would view at one time, and can navigate to
    adjacent pages by moving up, down, left or right (typically in left-to-right,
    top-to-bottom reading order, but also moving directionally or choosing to
    navigate to a different sheet based on prompts displayed on the screen)

## status

this is a toy project in the very early stages of development.
